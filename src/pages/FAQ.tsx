    answer: (
      <div>
        The Travel Impact Model (TIM) is a transparent & continuously improving emissions estimation
        model developed by Google that is built from public and licensable external datasets and
        based on the latest science. It aims to provide a single source of reliable information, as
        a public good, for calculating and presenting the climate impact of individual flight trips
        to passengers. An independent Advisory Committee was{" "}

        />{" "}
        to develop recommendations for improvements to the TIM.

    question: "Why is the TIM needed?",

        to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050, and is developing new
        technologies to support that goal. But work is needed to mobilize consumers to support early
        adopters of those technologies. While{" "}

        that consumers can reduce their per trip CO2 emissions by 22 to 63% by choosing the least
        emitting flights, more consistent and transparent data is needed to help identify those
        flights.

  {
    question: "Where is the TIM used today?",
    answer: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          The TIM is currently used by a number of travel search/technology providers to display
          emission estimates. These include: Google Flights, Skyscanner, Booking.com, Expedia and
          Sabre.

        <li>
          Other members of the{" "}
          <Link text="Travalyst coalition" href="https://travalyst.org/industry/" /> like Amadeus
          and Travelport have also committed to using the TIM in the near future.
        </li>
        <li>
          The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), Travalyst, and Google will
          continue to promote the adoption of the TIM across the industry to encourage greater
          consistency for prospective travelers.

    question: "What is the ICCTâ€™s role as Secretariat?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        As Secretariat, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) conducts background
        research, moderates meetings, publicly communicates Advisory Committee decisions, engages
        external stakeholders, and undertakes other tasks to support the Advisory Committee.
